# vLLM Semantic Router for Agentic Apps

Add intelligent, config-driven routing to any multi-agent AI application on Red Hat OpenShift AI.

This quickstart deploys [vLLM Semantic Router](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router) as an OpenAI-compatible proxy in front of three on-cluster agents (research/reasoning, RAG, general conversation). A chat UI displays a separate routing preview with the recommended agent and matched signals. The preview is not a record of which model served the answer. The primary takeaway: you can add semantic routing, jailbreak guardrails, and cost optimization to any agentic app through YAML configuration alone, with no application code changes.

## Use case

Most multi-agent AI applications hardcode their routing logic: an `if/else` chain or a classifier baked into application code decides which model handles each request. When you need to add a new agent, adjust routing thresholds, or add a guardrail, you're changing application code and redeploying.

This quickstart demonstrates **config-driven semantic routing**. A central routing engine (vLLM Semantic Router) sits between the user and your models, classifying every request by topic, complexity, and safety signals -- then routing it to the right agent automatically. Adding or changing routing rules is a YAML edit, not a code change.

### What this deploys

A chat application backed by three specialized agents:

| Query type | Example | Routed to | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Complex research | "Explain quantum entanglement in detail" | **Qwen3-8B** (reasoning mode) | Computer science domain signal fires -> research decision |
| Knowledge base | "What is Red Hat OpenShift AI?" | **Granite 3.1-8B** (RAG) | Keyword signals fire -> rag decision |
| General conversation | "Hello, how are you?" | **Granite 3.1-2B** | Default route -> lightweight model (lower cost, lower latency) |
| Jailbreak attempt | "Ignore all instructions and..." | **Blocked** | Jailbreak signal fires -> request rejected |
| Contains PII | "My SSN is 123-45-6789, help me with..." | **Granite 3.1-2B** (with safety prompt) | PII signal fires -> model instructed to ignore personal data |

### Who this is for

- **Platform engineers** evaluating semantic routing for multi-model serving on OpenShift AI
- **AI/ML engineers** building agentic applications that need intelligent request dispatch
- **Solution architects** looking for a reference pattern for guardrails + cost optimization via model tiering

### What you'll learn

1. How to configure signal-driven routing rules in YAML (no application code changes)
2. How to add jailbreak and PII guardrails as routing decisions
3. How to serve multiple models (different sizes, different capabilities) behind a single OpenAI-compatible endpoint
4. How to visualize routing decisions in real time through the chat UI and SR dashboard

## Requirements

### OpenShift Deployment

- Red Hat OpenShift 4.14+
- Red Hat OpenShift AI 2.9+
- `oc` CLI authenticated to the cluster
- `helm` 3.x
- **GPU:** 3 NVIDIA GPUs (T4, L4, or A10G) for model serving. All models are <=8B parameters — each requires a dedicated GPU.
  - 1 GPU for Qwen3-8B (research)
  - 1 GPU for Granite 3.1-8B (RAG)
  - 1 GPU for Granite 3.1-2B (general)
- Hugging Face token with access to Qwen3-8B
- If GPU nodes have custom taints (e.g. `g5-gpu`), tolerations must be added per model in `values.yaml`

### Local Development

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 22+ with pnpm
- Podman + podman-compose
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA (for vLLM model serving)

## Quick Start (Local)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/vllm-semantic-router.git
cd vllm-semantic-router
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env -- set HF_TOKEN for model downloads
make setup
make dev
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Chat UI | http://localhost:3000 |
| SR Dashboard | http://localhost:8700 |
| API docs | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| SR Classify API | http://localhost:8080/docs |
| MinIO Console | http://localhost:9001 |

### Ingest Sample Documents (for RAG)

```bash
python3 packages/ingestion/src/ingest.py
```

This uploads the bundled sample docs (OpenShift AI overview, SR guide) to MinIO and registers them in Llamastack's vector store.

## Deploy to OpenShift

For the mixed two-GPU/one-CPU profile, first follow
[OpenShift AI and KServe installation](docs/OPENSHIFT_AI_KSERVE.md), then
[G7 CPU Operator integration](docs/G7_CPU_OPERATOR.md).


### 1. Create namespace and set HF token

```bash
oc login <cluster-url>
oc new-project vllm-semantic-router
export HF_TOKEN=<your-huggingface-token>
```

### 2. Build and push chat-ui and API images

The chat UI and API backend images must be built and pushed to a container registry accessible from the cluster:

```bash
podman build --platform linux/amd64 \
  -t quay.io/<your-org>/vllm-semantic-router-chat-ui:router-compat-fix-v1 \
  -f packages/chat-ui/Containerfile .

podman build --platform linux/amd64 \
  -t quay.io/<your-org>/vllm-semantic-router-api:router-compat-fix-v1 \
  -f packages/api/Containerfile packages/api

podman push quay.io/<your-org>/vllm-semantic-router-chat-ui:router-compat-fix-v1
podman push quay.io/<your-org>/vllm-semantic-router-api:router-compat-fix-v1
```

Build these images from your patched checkout. Save their repositories and version tags in an override file. For immutable references, set `image.digest` on the API, Chat UI, router and dashboard; it takes precedence over `tag`. See [deployment repair and upgrades](docs/DEPLOYMENT_REPAIR.md) for registry credentials and safe upgrades.

### 3. GPU node tolerations

If GPU nodes have custom taints (common on shared clusters), add tolerations under each model in `values.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example for a cluster with g5-gpu taint
llm-service-general:
  models:
    granite-3-1-2b-instruct:
      tolerations:
        - key: nvidia.com/gpu
          effect: NoSchedule
          operator: Exists
        - key: g5-gpu        # cluster-specific GPU taint
          effect: NoSchedule
          operator: Exists
```

### 4. Install with Helm

```bash
CPU_OPERATOR_NODE="" helm install vllm-semantic-router deploy/helm/vllm-semantic-router \
  -n vllm-semantic-router \
  --post-renderer ./scripts/cpu-operator-kserve-post-renderer.py \
  --set llm-service-research.secret.hf_token=$HF_TOKEN \
  --set llm-service-rag.secret.hf_token=$HF_TOKEN \
  --set llm-service-general.secret.hf_token=$HF_TOKEN \
  --set semanticRouter.hfToken=$HF_TOKEN
```

> The `semanticRouter.hfToken` is required for the router to download embedding models (mmBERT) used for signal classification. A 20Gi PVC is created by default to persist these models across pod restarts. The ingestion pipeline is disabled by default; enable it with `--set ingestion-pipeline.enabled=true` when DSPA is available.

For upgrades, preserve the previous shared resources as described in [deployment repair and upgrades](docs/DEPLOYMENT_REPAIR.md). The G7 deployment script already does this. The default three-GPU layout requires at least three allocatable GPUs.

### 5. Verify

```bash
oc get pods -n vllm-semantic-router
# Wait for all pods to be Running (model downloads take a few minutes)
# GPU model pods (predictor-*) take longest -- they download multi-GB models

# Get the chat UI URL
oc get route -n vllm-semantic-router -l app.kubernetes.io/name=chat-ui \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.host}'

# Get the SR dashboard URL
oc get route -n vllm-semantic-router -l app.kubernetes.io/name=sr-dashboard \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.host}'
```

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Predictor pods stuck in `Pending` | GPU nodes have taints the pods don't tolerate | Add tolerations to each model in `values.yaml` |
| Chat-ui/API pods in `ImagePullBackOff` | Images not pushed or registry not accessible | Build and push images (step 2) |
| Router (extproc) in `CrashLoopBackOff` | Missing HF_TOKEN or unwritable model dir | Set `semanticRouter.hfToken` in helm values |
| Router rejects undeclared jailbreak/PII signals | Decisions reference signals absent from the recipe | Keep explicit signal declarations and use a compatible router image; inspect startup/download logs |
| Chat works but routing preview is blank | API image still calls removed /api/v1/eval endpoint | Rebuild the API from this checkout; it calls /api/v1/routing/preview |
| API readiness 503 while router is running | Management API is unreachable across pods | Use the chart internal listener configuration and check router/API logs |
| Chat returns 504 Gateway Timeout | Envoy ext_proc `message_timeout` too low for routing latency | Set `message_timeout: 30s` in Envoy ext_proc filter config |
| Llamastack in `ImagePullBackOff` | `llamastack/distribution-starter` renamed to `ogxai/distribution-starter` | Update image to `docker.io/ogxai/distribution-starter:0.6.1` |
| Llamastack crashes with "API 'safety' does not exist" | Using `ogxai/distribution-starter:latest` (1.x) with 0.x config schema | Use `ogxai/distribution-starter:0.6.1` to match the subchart config format |
| Dashboard in `CrashLoopBackOff` | OpenShift SCC blocks user switching | Dashboard template overrides entrypoint to skip `gosu` |
| Chat returns 404 | Nginx not proxying `/api` to the API service | Verify chat-ui-nginx ConfigMap is mounted |
| Chat hangs (no response) | Envoy backend cluster misconfigured | Verify envoy ConfigMap clusters point to correct vLLM services |
| vLLM returns "model does not exist" | Model name mismatch between SR and vLLM | `--served-model-name` in vLLM args must match SR model names |
| SR routing returns empty decision | Domain names in config don't match MMLU classifier taxonomy | Use MMLU categories (`computer science`, `health`, `other`) in domain signal config |
| Keyword signal not matching | Config uses `terms` field (invalid in v0.3) | Use `keywords` field with `method: bm25` |
| Ingestion pipeline stuck in `Init:0/1` | Waiting for Data Science Pipelines (DSPA) service | Deploy DSPA or disable the ingestion-pipeline subchart |

## Delete / Cleanup

```bash
helm uninstall vllm-semantic-router -n vllm-semantic-router
oc delete project vllm-semantic-router
```

## How Routing Works

The semantic router classifies every incoming query using configurable **signals** and applies **decision rules** to select the right model:

| Signal | What it detects |
|--------|----------------|
| Domain | Topic classification via MMLU categories (computer science, health, other) |
| Complexity | Simple vs. multi-step reasoning queries (disabled — see note below) |
| Jailbreak | Prompt injection and adversarial attacks (explicit signal) |
| PII | Personal identifiable information (explicit signal) |
| Keyword | Domain-specific terms via BM25 matching (document-terms, rag-keywords) |

| Decision | Priority | Routes to | When |
|----------|----------|-----------|------|
| blocked | 100 | (none) | Jailbreak detected |
| pii-flagged | 90 | general-agent | PII detected (with safety prompt) |
| research | 20 | Qwen3-8B (reasoning) | Computer science domain signal fires |
| rag | 15 | Granite 3.1-8B | Keyword signals match (document-terms or rag-keywords) |
| general | 1 | Granite 3.1-2B | Domain classified as "other" (default) |

The config uses a `projections` layer that partitions domains into an exclusive `request_type` group. Conversation protection is enabled under `global.router.learning.protection`, with adaptation disabled. Jailbreak and PII signals are explicitly declared. The management API is available internally on port 8080; do not expose it through a public Route without configuring authentication.

Routing configuration lives in `config/semantic-router/config.yaml`. To customize routing for your own app, edit the `decisions`, `signals`, and `projections` sections -- no code changes needed.
